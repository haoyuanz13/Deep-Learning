The intact simplified faster rcnn strcuture for cifar10 classification, including RPN and Spatial Transformer function (tf and pure numpy version).

Pkg Clarification
-------------------
1. The 'layers.py' contains multiple functional layers such as ConvNet, Fully Connected Layers and ResNet Block.    
2. The 'spatial_transformer.py' includes the spatial transformer function.     
3. The 'fasterRCNN.py' contains the main structure of Faster RCNN combined with RPN, as well as the executable function for training and test.      
4. The 'helper.py' file includes all helper functions such as data loading and result figure plotting.
