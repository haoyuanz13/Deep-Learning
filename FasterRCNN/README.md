The Faster RCNN model to play with cifar10 and cifar100 data
------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, we use the cifar100 data (48x48x3) as background, put the cifar10 data (32x32x3) at the top of that with different location.

Transformed data can be find in the below link:
