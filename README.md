Deep Learning
-------------
Deep network structure Projects with source code, most of them contain PyTorch and Tensorflow two versions.    

Keep uploading and learning.....
--------------------------------
1. Have included the deep network for playing with cifar10/100 data to achieve object classification.       
2. Uploaded simple FasterRCNN network. (Detect cifar10 with the cifar100 as background).      
3. Completed DCGAN, WGAN and WGAN-GP for dataset CUFS and celebA.
4. Uploaded 3D object detection network for 3D MNIST dataset.
5. Uploaded AE, VAE network for dataset CUFS and celebA.
6. Completed Image to Image network for dataset CUFS and Facades.
